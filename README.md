# Corvina Keepers

Corvina Keepers is a custodial framework for preserving physical cultural artifacts
through transparent digital minting and ethical governance.

This repository contains **White Paper v1**, which defines the foundational principles,
structures, and constraints of the Corvina Keepers system.

## White Paper

📄 **Corvina Keepers – White Paper v1 (PDF)**

---

## Scope

This repository documents **version 1** of the Corvina Keepers framework.

Version 1 is intentionally minimal and demonstrative:
- it defines the ethical and structural foundation,
- it is sufficient for the first smart contract implementation,
- it serves as a practical example of custodial minting in action.

Later versions may refine or extend this framework based on community review.

---

## Core Principles

- Physical cultural artifacts require **real custody**, not abstraction.
- Digital tokens must be **anchored to verifiable physical deposits**.
- No forced participation, no coercive enforcement.
- Transparency replaces legal intimidation.
- Responsibility precedes scale.

---

## Non-Promises / Disclaimer

Corvina Keepers does **not** promise:
- profit,
- yield,
- investment returns,
- or financial appreciation.

Participation implies understanding the **symbolic, custodial, cultural, and ethical**
nature of the framework.

---

## Versioning

- **v1** – Founder-proposed, minimal operational model  
- **v2** – Community-reviewed refinement (planned)  
- **v3** – Governance and scaling (future)

Only v1 is defined in this repository.
